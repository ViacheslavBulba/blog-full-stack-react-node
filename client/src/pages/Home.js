                You've learned React and can create amazing front-end interfaces. 
                But deploying them requires more. 
                You need logic â€” and a place to put it. 
                By combining your front-end UI with a back-end solution and cloud hosting, 
                you can build powerful and interactive full-stack applications. 
                In this project we learn how to combine React and Node.js 
                in a full-stack, full-featured website. 
                Learn how to create an interface from React components and develop a Node.js server.
